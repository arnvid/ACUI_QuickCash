        Adds a little strip of a window which is a functioning cash display.

        Thanks to sarf for the Rogue Helper code which was very informative and useful.
        Some utility type code is directly from RogueHelper (hope thats ok).
        Also thanks to Trentin for MonkeyQuest which I had a gander at.
